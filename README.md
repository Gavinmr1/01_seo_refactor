# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

I replaced all of the div tags with semantic tags (main), (article), (aside), and (nav).
I fixed the broken nav link.
I cleaned up the format and added a title. 
I added alt attributes to each of the images with the exception of hero which I left in css.
There were a lot of excess css code for (article) and (aside) so I minimized the amount of code used.
